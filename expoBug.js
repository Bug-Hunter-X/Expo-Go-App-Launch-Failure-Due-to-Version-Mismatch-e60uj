This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the Expo Go app version installed on your device and the version of Expo CLI you're using to run your project.  Expo updates frequently, and if there's an incompatibility, you'll encounter issues launching your app.  This can manifest as a blank screen, a crash, or various error messages within Expo Go.
